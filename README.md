# Sales Portal

Sales Portal is a dashboard for the software product, Enteris: ENTERprise Index and Search (http://www.originssoft.com/enteris). 
Users can signup, buy subscription, make monthly payments, define payment details, perform content search and cancel subscription. The same portal is used by the admins to perform site administration.

The tasks performed by the administrators include defining feature elements, create user roles (using a set of feature elements), create and activate users, assign roles to the users, define payment methods, see payments and event history and a number of "to be decided" tasks.
